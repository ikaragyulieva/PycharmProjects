# You come across an old JS Basics teamwork game. It is about bunnies that multiply extremely fast.
# There's also a player that should escape from their lair.
# You like the game, so you decide to port it to Python because that's your language of choice.
# The last thing left is the algorithm that determines if the player will escape the lair or not.
# First, you will receive a line holding integers N and M, representing the lair's rows and columns.
# Next, you receive N strings that can consist only of ".", "B", "P". They represent the initial state of the lair.
# There will be only one player. The bunnies are marked with "B", the player is marked with "P",
# and everything else is free space, marked with a dot ".".
# Then you will receive a string with commands (e.g., LRRULUD) - each letter represents the next move of the player:
# •	L - the player should move one position to the left
# •	R - the player should move one position to the right
# •	U - the player should move one position up
# •	D - the player should move one position down
# After every step made, each bunny spreads one position up, down, left, and right.
# If the player moves to a bunny cell or a bunny reaches the player, the player dies.
# If the player goes out of the lair without encountering a bunny, the player wins.
# When the player dies or wins, the game ends. All the activities for this turn continue
# (e.g., all the bunnies spread normally), but there are no more turns.
# There will be no cases where the moves of the player end before he dies or escapes.
# In the end, print the final state of the lair with every row on a separate line.
# On the last line, print either "dead: {row} {col}" or "won: {row} {col}". "Row" and "col" are the cell coordinates
# where the player has died or the last cell he has been in before escaping the lair.
# Input
# •	On the first line of input, the numbers N and M are received - the number of rows and columns in the lair
# •	On the following N lines, each row is received in the form of a string. The string will contain only ".", "B", "P".
# All strings will be the same length. There will be only one "P" for all the input
# •	On the last line, the directions are received in the form of a string, containing "R", "L", "U", "D"
# Output
# •	On the first N lines, print the final state of the bunny lair
# •	On the last line, print:
# o	If the player won - "won: {row} {col}"
# o	If the player dies - "dead: {row} {col}"
# Constraints
# •	The dimensions of the lair are in the range [3…20]
# •	The directions string length is in the range [1…20]
