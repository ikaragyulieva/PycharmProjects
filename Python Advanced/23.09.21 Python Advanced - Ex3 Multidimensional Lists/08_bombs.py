# You will be given a square matrix of integers, each integer separated by a single space,
# and each row will be on a new line. On the last line of input, you will receive indexes -
# coordinates of several cells separated by a single space, in the following format:
# "{row1},{column1} {row2},{column2} … {row3},{column3}".
# On those cells, there are bombs. You must detonate every bomb in the order they were given.
# When a bomb explodes, it deals damage equal to its integer value to all the cells around it
# (in every direction and in all diagonals).
# One bomb can't explode more than once, and after it does, its value becomes 0.
# When a cell's value reaches 0 or below, it dies. Dead cells can't explode.
# You must print the count of all alive cells and their sum.
# Afterward, print the matrix with all its cells (including the dead ones).
# Input
# •	On the first line, you are given the integer N - the size of the square matrix.
# •	The following N lines hold each column's values - N numbers separated by a space.
# •	On the last line, you will receive the coordinates of the cells with the bombs in the format described above.
# Output
# •	On the first line, you need to print the count of all alive cells in the format:
# "Alive cells: {alive_cells}"
# •	On the second line, you need to print the sum of all alive cells in the format:
# "Sum: {sum_of_cells}"
# •	In the end, print the matrix. A space must separate the cells.
# Constraints
# •	The size of the matrix will be between [0…1000].
# •	The bomb coordinates will always be in the matrix.
# •	The bomb's values will always be greater than 0.
# •	The integers of the matrix will be in the range [1…10000].
