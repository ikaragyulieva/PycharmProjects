# Write function called best_list_pureness which will receive a list of numbers and a number K.
# You have to rotate the list K times (last becomes first) to find the variation of the list with the best pureness
# (pureness is calculated by summing all the elements in the list multiplied by their indices).
# For example, in the list [4, 3, 2, 6] with the best pureness is (3 * 0) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 2) + (4 * 3) = 26.
# At the end the function should return a string containing the highest pureness and the amount of rotations that were
# made to find this pureness in the following format: "Best pureness {pureness_value} after {count_rotations} rotations"
# If there is more than one highest pureness, take the first one.
# Note: Submit only the function in the judge system
# Input
# â€¢	There will be no input, just parameters passed to your function
# Output
# â€¢	There is no expected output
# â€¢	The function should return a string in the following format:
# "Best pureness {pureness_value} after {count_rotations} rotations"
